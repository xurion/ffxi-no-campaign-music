# FFXI - No Campaign Music

Prevents all campaign battle music from playing in Final Fantasy XI, so you can listen to that sweet music that is normally obnoxiously interrupted.

## Load

```
//lua load ncm
```

## Campaign notifications

If you want to know when campaign is happening, you can toggle notifications:

```
//ncm notify
```
